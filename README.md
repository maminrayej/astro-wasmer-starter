This is a [Astro](https://nextjs.org/) starter kit bootstrapped with `npm create astro@latest -- --template basics`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run with Wasmer

You can run the Astro template easily using Wasmer:

```bash
wasmer run wasmer-tests/wasmer-edge-astro-sample --net -- --port 3000
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also run `wasmer run . --net -- --port 3000` in the root of this repo, after running `npm run build`


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Deploy on Wasmer Edge

The easiest way to deploy your Astro App is to use the [Wasmer Edge](https://wasmer.io/products/edge).

Live example: http://wasmer-edge-astro-sample.wasmer.app/

First, you'll need to run `npm run build`, and then, to deploy to Wasmer Edge:

```bash
wasmer deploy
```

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to have Wasmer installed (check out [the docs to install the Wasmer CLI](https://docs.wasmer.io/install)!). 
> You will also need to change the namespace in `wasmer.toml` to your own namespace and app name in `app.yaml` to your own app name.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
